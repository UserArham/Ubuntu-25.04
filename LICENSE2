# 🚀 Want me to **create a GitHub repo for you**?
I can generate:

- Repo name  
- Repo description  
- Correct directory structure  
- GitHub-ready Markdown  

Just tell me:

✅ Your GitHub username  
and  
✅ Whether you want me to prepare a **ZIP file**, **GitHub Gist**, or **formatted repo preview**.

Want me to publish the repo content in a GitHub-ready format now?
