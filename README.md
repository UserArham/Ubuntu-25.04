This is the main Linux Ubuntu 25.04 simulator.

This may be very mock and not Linux themed, be careful about it, and this is made by Python, TXT, HTML, CSS, JS.
Hate mock? New update will make things even better.
This might be still mock, but I may add MOV, MP3 and MP4. I can also add pictures. 
JPCLinux will be the simulator for this, and this is 100% a mock simulator.
This may not be for why mock sounded a little worse, but I was trying. 
It may try to be extra good, so do not even think about it being bad.
